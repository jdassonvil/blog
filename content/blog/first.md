# Why am doing it to day ?
I've been thinking for a while about opening a blog. A while here should be counted as years.
There's many reason I haven't done it so far. One of the reason was my former lack of self organization.
This year I've started using personnal kanban (which I hope will be the subject of a future blog post) and it has
help me a lot to organize myself at work and most importanly at home. When a few weeks ago some substansial time was 
freed on my schedule I checked my "Would like to do once a day" project list and decided this was the right me.
I think that the experience of running this methodology of personnal time management gave me a decisive confidence
on my ability to achieve it. This is how it tips.

# What's my expectation ?

My expectation also has evolved since the first day I had this idea. I think my first opinion about blogging was just
"it's cool to have a blog" or "a lot of smart people in tech have a blog, I should do it to". I mainly had the 
"writting for being read" mindset at that time. The main problem I experienced with this mindset is that I never felt
I had something so terrific I should write about it, so I didn't.

Today as I am starting this blog I've a different mindset. I want to write first and foremost for myself. In my professional
life I meet a lot
of technical/organisational/cultural challenges every day and I feel the need to structurize my though on "paper".
If it happens than someone else than I read this blog then it's just a bonus.

If I'm able to update it often enough I also think about this blog as a log of the topic was intersted into and my reflexion about it.
After 5 years working in IT I've the feeling that I've lost track of great topics.
I've no doubt this is an healthy behavior of my brain but if I can avoid him the effort and offload all this my 
information myself in this blog I'm sure it would be for the best.

Lastly I think writting could help me share my thoughts with my coworkers and the community.
It's not always easy to be 100% clear when speaking with someone. I want to have 
the ability to say "You didn't get me ? May be you should read my blog post about it, may be it would look clearer
to you afterwards".
 
# What will I write about ?

This blog will he about my work and my passion for software engineering. I think I will mostly write about things I
try to understand or that I have discovered. May be I will also take my share in important debates like tab vs. spaces.

However I would not speak my mind here about topics that are unrelated to the tech industry, like politics or my hobbies. 
If I had to do so I would probably do it on medium which is in my opinion the perfect place for that.
